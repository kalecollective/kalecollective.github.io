<h1 class="svelte-6bi96f">Smart Mobility Challenge Successfully Completed</h1>
<p class="svelte-6bi96f">13th January 2022</p>
<div class="post svelte-6bi96f"><p>2021 was a big year for Kale Collective. In May we applied to enter the <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/event/the-mayors-resilience-fund/" rel="nofollow">Mayor of Londonâ€™s Resilience Fund</a> Smart Mobility innovation challenge. In June we submitted our proposal, in July we were chosen as winners of the challenge, and <a href="/blog/introducing-kale-collective">in September we moved into our new offices</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of 2021 we worked with Kingâ€™s College and Better Bankside developing our tool to help urban businesses use their delivery vehicles more efficiently. Our tool specifically focuses on identifying opportunities to switch to electric cargo bikes and electric vans.</p>
<p>Many organisations struggle with changing their operations: itâ€™s easier to continue with a system that already works, and the upfront costs of a transition can hide the long term benefits.</p>
<p>Yet the potential for change is huge.</p>
<p>For example, 39% of van trips in London operate at <a href="https://www.urbantransportgroup.org/system/files/general-docs/White%20Van%20Cities.pdf" rel="nofollow">less than a quarter full</a>. Many of those could be substituted by cargo bikes, with direct economical benefits, faster speeds in a congested city centre, and drastic environmental benefits. Similarly, a number of tax incentives and developments in EV technology make the switch to an electric fleet more and more attractive. In the UK, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/978087/van-statistics-2019-to-2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">97% of vans are still powered by diesel</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-of-kings-college-london"><a href="#the-case-of-kings-college-london">The Case of Kingâ€™s College London</a></h2>
<p>Below, our tool crunches the GPS data of the vans in Kingâ€™s fleet and A) estimates their yearly climate budget and B) identifies how the fleet can be changed to improve the climate impact.</p>
<div class="figureContainer svelte-1aydev8"><figure class="svelte-1aydev8"><img src="/blog/climate_impact.png" width="1376" height="2488" alt="Screenshot of climate impact breakdown which is 8.8 tonnes COâ‚‚ distributed on 7 vans. Some vans drive much more than others." class="svelte-1aydev8">
    <figcaption class="svelte-1aydev8">Yearly COâ‚‚ emitted by King&#39;s College&#39;s vans.</figcaption></figure>
  <figure class="svelte-1aydev8"><img src="/blog/remode_cargobikes.png" width="1376" height="2488" alt="Screenshot of vehicles that can be switched to cargo bikes. If all 6 possible vans were replaced the total carbon footprint would be 2.1 tonnes of COâ‚‚, a reduction of 76.1%." class="svelte-1aydev8">
    <figcaption class="svelte-1aydev8">Overview of vans that could be replaced with cargo bikes.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>6 out of 7 Kingâ€™s vans make trips that are short enough and generally with loads small enough to be carried out by cargo bikes. The figure below shows the trip length distribution of a typical van. It is evident from this plot that the vast majority of trips are doable by a bike. Kingâ€™s operates in central London where the average speed of an electric bicycle is greater than of a van. Switching to a cargo bike therefore not only reduces the climate impact but also saves time and money. We estimate the benefits of making the change to be: 76.1% COâ‚‚ reduction, Â£12,108 yearly financial benefit, and 1,689 driving hours per year saved.</p>
<div class="figureContainer svelte-1aydev8"><figure style="width: 50%" class="svelte-1aydev8"><img src="/blog/trip_distribution.png" width="809" height="554" alt="Distribution of trip distances of a single van. The majority of trips are shorter than 5 km, a few are between 5 and 10 km long and no trips are longer than 15 km." class="svelte-1aydev8">
    <figcaption class="svelte-1aydev8">Distribution of trip length of one van. Most trips are shorter than 10km long. The van is rarely fully loaded and most of these trips could be done more efficiently by an electric cargo bike.</figcaption></figure></div>
<h2 id="looking-forward"><a href="#looking-forward">Looking forward</a></h2>
<p>Kingâ€™s Collegeâ€™s operation team has used these insights to start improving their fleet and take actions with the largest climate impact. This project would not have been a success without the excellent collaboration with Amandeep Kellay from Better Bankside, Nicola Hogan from Kingâ€™s College London and the rest of the Kingâ€™s operations team.</p>
<p>We have had a great start to 2022 and are already brewing on some new, exciting projects. Stay tuned for whatâ€™s to come! ðŸŽ‰</p>
